# HumorBot

/u/RoyalChampionBot is a reddit bot that assists post moderation on r/ClashOfClans. 
It enforces Rule 11, "Humor Weekends": 
- "Humor Weekend" Starts at Friday, 5:00 PM EST
- "Humor Weekend" Ends Monday, 2 AM EST
- Any post flaired with Humor & Memes outside of these times will be removed.
- All memes posted outside of humor weekends will be removed
- Humor Posts are still subject to other rules of the sub

**Q: Why not just use Automoderator?**

A: Automoderator doesn't have a feature allowing rule enforcement only on specific days. This means the mods have to switch between 2 Automod configurations when Humour weekends are turned on/off. 

**Q: The bot removed my post when it wasn't supposed to. What do I do?**

A: Contact the r/ClashOfClans mods here. Or send a DM to /u/DavisAF
